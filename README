FAQ
    -   QUESTION – What is a one-time-pad?
        ANSWER: A one-time-pad is a type of encryption that is used to hide the contents of a message. Each letter in the encrypted phrase has a corresponding "one-time-pad" number. This number is then used to decrypt the message. Each one-time-pad number is a random number, and thus is impossible to guess and is theoretically impossible to crack by brute force. One-time-pads are used to hide messages in email, chat, and other online communication. More information on this method can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad).
